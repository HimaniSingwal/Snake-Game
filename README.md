**Description**
This Snake Game is a fun and simple game created using Pygame. The player controls a snake, and the goal is to eat the food that randomly appears on the screen. Every time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the game becomes more challenging as the snake speeds up.

**How to Play**
. Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake (up, down, left, right).
. The goal is to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen.
. Each time you eat food, the snake grows longer.
. Avoid colliding with the edges of the screen or the snake's own body, or you’ll lose the game.
. To restart after losing, press C, or press Q to quit.
